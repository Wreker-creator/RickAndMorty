//Its not best practice to carry this response model to our domain layer
//If we go ahead and trace where the code is being called we will notice that when we call the
// function refreshCharacter, we actually make a network request and post the information to a
// live data to our domain or our viewLayer, the live data of the type GetCharacterById response.
// The position where it is being observed , we will notice that it is a network layer response,
// and we are using it directly in our domain layer which is not a good practice and doesnâ€™t leave
// us with much room for further development. We are referencing the network response object
// in our code which is not the best practice and prevents further development as well.
//
//So we need to separate domain layer from network layer.
//
//With every domain and network model we need to create a mapper so we can simultaneously compress
// our network data to domain data. A bit of manipulation which will help us.
